save_dataset_csv(
  data = NULL,
  path,
  variable,
  qc_types = NA,

\arguments{
\item{data}{MidarExperiment object}

\item{path}{File name with path of exported CSV file}

\item{variable}{Variable to be exported, must be present in the data and any of "area", "height", "intensity", "norm_intensity", "response", "conc", "conc_raw", "rt", "fwhm".}

\item{qc_types}{QC types to be plotted. Can be a vector of QC types or a regular expression pattern. \code{NA} (default) displays all available QC/Sample types.}

\item{filter_data}{A logical value indicating whether to use all data
(default) or only QC-filtered data (filtered via \code{\link[=filter_features_qc]{filter_features_qc()}}).}

\item{include_qualifier}{A logical value indicating whether to include
qualifier features. Default is \code{NA}, which will be automatically set to \code{FALSE}
if \code{variable} is \code{conc} or \code{conc_raw}, and \code{FALSE} otherwise.}

\item{include_istd}{A logical value indicating whether to include internal
standard (ISTD) features. Default is \code{NA}, which will be automatically set to \code{FALSE}
if \code{variable} is ''norm_intensity\verb{, }conc\code{or}conc_raw\verb{, and }TRUE` otherwise.}

\item{include_feature_filter}{A character or regex pattern used to filter
features by \code{feature_id}. If \code{NA} or an empty string (\code{""}) is provided,
the filter is ignored. When a vector of length > 1 is supplied, only
features with exactly these names are selected (applied individually as
OR conditions).}

\item{exclude_feature_filter}{A character or regex pattern used to exclude
features by \code{feature_id}. If \code{NA} or an empty string (\code{""}) is provided,
the filter is ignored. When a vector of length > 1 is supplied, only
features with exactly these names are excluded (applied individually as
OR conditions).}

\item{add_qctype}{Add the QC type as column}
}
\description{
This function exports specific unprocessed or pr ocessed feature variable
(e.g. intensities or concentrations) from a \code{MidarExperiment} object to a CSV file.
Allows selection of features and optional QC filtering.
