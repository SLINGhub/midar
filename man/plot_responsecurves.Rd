\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{MidarExperiment} object containing the dataset and metadata.}

\item{variable}{The variable to plot on the y-axis.}

\item{filter_data}{Whether to use all data (default) or only
QC-filtered data (filtered via \code{\link[=filter_features_qc]{filter_features_qc()}}).}

\item{include_qualifier}{Logical, whether to include qualifier features. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{include_istd}{Logical, whether to include internal standard (ISTD) features. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{include_feature_filter}{A regex pattern or a vector of feature names used to filter features by \code{feature_id}.
If \code{NA} or an empty string (\code{""}) is provided, the filter is ignored. When a vector of length > 1 is supplied,
is supplied, only features with exactly these names are selected (applied individually as OR conditions).}

\item{exclude_feature_filter}{A regex pattern or a vector of feature names to exclude features by feature_id.
If \code{NA} or an empty string (\code{""}) is provided, the filter is ignored. When a vector of length > 1 is supplied,
is supplied, only features with exactly these names are excluded (applied individually as OR conditions).}

\item{max_regression_value}{The maximum sample_amount (x) value for fitting
the regression line. If \code{NA}, regression is based on all data points.}

\item{output_pdf}{If \code{TRUE}, saves the generated plots as a PDF
file. Wjen \code{FALSE}, plots are directly plotted.}

\item{path}{The file path for saving the PDF. Must be defined if
\code{output_pdf} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{return_plots}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, returns the plots as a list of
\code{ggplot2} objects.}

\item{color_curves}{A vector of colors for the curves. If \code{NULL} (default),
the colors for each curve are generated automatically. If colors are provided,
the number of colors must match the number of curves.}

\item{point_size}{Size of points in millimeters.}

\item{line_width}{Width of regression lines.}

\item{font_base_size}{Base font size for text. Default is 7.}

\item{rows_page}{Number of rows of plots per page.}

\item{cols_page}{Number of columns of plots per page.}

\item{specific_page}{An integer specifying a specific page to plot. If
\code{NA} (default), all pages are plotted.}

\item{page_orientation}{Orientation of the PDF paper: \code{"LANDSCAPE"} or
\code{"PORTRAIT"}.}

\item{show_progress}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, displays a progress bar during
plot creation.}
}
\value{
If \code{return_plots} is \code{TRUE}, a list of \code{ggplot2} objects is
returned. Otherwise, the function saves the plot output or does not return
anything.
}
\description{
This function plots response curves for each feature. Multiple response curves,
each with a linear regression line, can be plotted on the same graph.
Each feature is displayed as a separate facet.
}
\details{
Features for plotting can be filtered using QC filters defined via
\code{\link[=filter_features_qc]{filter_features_qc()}} or through \code{include_feature_filter} and
\code{exclude_feature_filter} arguments. The resulting plots offer extensive
customization options, including point size, line width, point color, point
fill, point shape, line color, ribbon fill, and font base size.

Plots will be divided into multiple pages if the number of features exceeds
the product of \code{rows_page} and \code{cols_page} settings. The function supports
both direct plotting within R and saving plots as PDF files. Additionally,
plots can be returned as a list of ggplot2 objects for further manipulation
or integration into other analyses.
