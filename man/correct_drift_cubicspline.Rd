\arguments{

\item{variable}{The variable to be corrected for drift effects. Must be one of "intensity", "norm_intensity", or "conc"}

\item{ref_qc_types}{QC types used for drift correction}

\item{batch_wise}{Logical. Apply the correction to each batch separately (\code{TRUE}, default) or across all batches (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{ignore_istd}{Logical. Exclude internal standards (ISTDs) from correction if \code{TRUE}.}

\item{replace_previous}{Logical. Replace existing correction (\code{TRUE}, default) or layer on top of it (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{cv}{Ordinary leave-one-out (TRUE) or ‘generalized’ cross-validation (GCV) when FALSE; is used for smoothing parameter computation only when spar is not specified}

\item{lambda}{Regularization parameter for cubic spline smoothing. Default is 0, which means no regularization.}

\item{penalty}{The coefficient of the penalty for degrees of freedom in the GCV criterion.}

\item{recalc_trend_after}{Recalculate trend post-drift correction for \code{plot_qc_runscatter()}. This will double calculation time.}

\item{cv_diff_threshold}{Maximum allowable change in CV ratio before and after smoothing for correction to be applied.}

\item{use_original_if_fail}{Determines the action when smoothing fails or results in invalid values for a feature. If \code{FALSE} (default), the result for each feature will \code{NA} for all batches, if \code{TRUE}, the original data is kept.}

\description{
This function corrects for run-order drifts within or across batches using
cubic spline smoothing. The correction is typically based on QC (Quality
Control) samples that are measured at specific intervals throughout the run
sequence. The smoothed curve derived from the QC samples is then used to
adjust all other samples in the dataset. The correction can be applied to "intensity",
"norm_intensity", or "conc" data.

The cubic spline smoothing approach, particularly when used with the
regularization parameter \code{lambda}, is similar but not identical to previously described
QC-based drift correction methods, such as \strong{QC-RSC (Quality Control Regularized
Spline Correction)}, described in Dunn et al. (Nat Protoc, 2011) and Kirwan et al.
(Anal Bioanal Chem, 2014).

By default, the smoothing parameter is determined using cross-validation,
which can lead to overfitting. To reduce overfitting
the regularization parameter \code{lambda} may be defined, with a good starting point
being \code{lambda = 0.01}. Additionally, the global
smoothing parameter can be specified via \code{spar}.

It is recommended to visually inspect the correction using the
\code{\link[=plot_runscatter]{plot_runscatter()}} function. Set the argument
\code{recalc_trend_after = TRUE} so that the trends after correction are also
available for plotting. For further details, refer to the description
of \code{\link[=plot_runscatter]{plot_runscatter()}}.

The corrections can be applied on a batch-by-batch basis (\code{batch_wise = TRUE}, default) or across all batches (\code{batch_wise = FALSE}). Existing
corrections are either replaced (\code{replace_previous = TRUE}) or added on top
of them (\code{replace_previous = FALSE}).

Furthermore, drift correction can be applied unconditionally
(\code{conditional_correction = FALSE}) or conditionally, based on whether the
sample CV change before and after correction is below a defined
threshold (\code{cv_diff_threshold}). This conditional correction is assessed
independently for each batch if \code{batch_wise = TRUE}, where the median of
the CV changes across the batch is compared with the threshold.

\strong{Note}: The function outputs a message indicating the median CV change
and the mean absolute CV before and after correction for all samples.
However, these metrics are experimental and should not be used as
definitive criteria for correction (see Details below).

This cubic spline method is implemented using the base R function
}
\details{
In the output message, the median CV change is computed as the median of CV changes for all
features in global correction or for
features where the correction passed the defined CV difference treshold in
case of conditional correction  (\code{conditional_correction = FALSE}).
For batch-wise correction, the change is calculated per batch, with the final median CV
change being the median of these batch medians across features.
