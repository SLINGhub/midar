\usage{
correct_batch_centering(
  data = NULL,
  variable,
  ref_qc_types,
  correct_scale = FALSE,
  replace_previous = TRUE,
  log_transform_internal = TRUE,
  replace_exisiting_trendcurves = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{MidarExperiment} object containing the data to be corrected.
This object must include information about QC types and measurements.}

\item{variable}{The variable to be corrected. Must be one of "intensity",
"norm_intensity", or "conc".}

\item{ref_qc_types}{A character vector specifying the QC types to be
used as references for batch centering.}

\item{correct_scale}{A logical value indicating whether to equalize the scale
of the batches in addition to center them. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{replace_previous}{A logical value indicating whether to replace any
previous batch corrections or apply the new correction on top. Defaults to
\code{TRUE} (replace).}

\item{log_transform_internal}{A logical value indicating whether to log-transform
the data internally during correction. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{replace_exisiting_trendcurves}{A logical value indicating whether to replace
trend curves from previous corrections. This is only use for plotting using \code{plot_runscatter()}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments that can be passed to the batch correction
function.}
}
\value{
A \code{MidarExperiment} object containing the corrected data.
}
\description{
This function performs batch centering correction on each feature.
Optionally, the scale of the batches can be equalized across batches.
The selected QC types (\code{ref_qc_types}) are used to calculate
the medians, which are then used to align all other samples. The
correction can be applied to one of three variables: "intensity",
"norm_intensity", or "conc". The correction can either be applied
on top of previous corrections or replace all prior batch corrections.

\code{plot_runscatter} for visualizing the correction before and after.
