\usage{
plot_qc_summary_byclass(data = NULL, font_base_size = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{MidarExperiment object}

\item{font_base_size}{The base font size for the plot. Default is \code{8}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object showing the feature QC filtering summary by feature class.
}
\description{
This function provides a summary of feature QC filtering based on feature class,
showing the number of features that passed or failed various quality control criteria.
It visualizes the filtering in a hierarchical sequence. Features are first evaluated
against lower-level filters such as signal-to-blank (S/B) ratios and limit of detection (LOD),
followed by higher-level filters like the coefficient of variation (CV) or linear regression results.
This means that a feature is classified as failing a given criterion (e.g., \code{CV})
only if it has passed all hierarchically lower filters (e.g., \code{S/B} ratio and \code{LOD}).
