\title{Get the total duration of the analysis}
\usage{
get_analysis_duration(data, estimate_sequence_end)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{MidarExperiment} object}

\item{estimate_sequence_end}{If \code{TRUE}, the function will estimate the end
time of the analysis sequence based on the median runtime, added to the timestamp of the last analysis.
If \code{FALSE}, the function will calculate the time difference between the first and last analysis timestamps
without any adjustment.}
}
\description{
This function returns the total duration of the analysis, which is the time difference
between the timestamps of the first and last analyses in the sequence.
}
\details{
If \code{estimate_sequence_end} is \code{TRUE}, the function will estimate the end time of the analysis sequence
by adding the median runtime to the timestamp of the last analysis, instead of simply using the timestamp
of the last analysis.
}
