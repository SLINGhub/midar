## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
devtools::load_all()
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

mexp3 <- readRDS(here(".testing/HealthyAthletes/output", paste0("P20036_HealthyAthletes_Baker2_MiQARreport.rds")))

plot_pca_sling(mexp3,variable = "CONC_FINAL", log_transform = TRUE, dim_x = 1, dim_y = 2, grouping = TRUE, fill_alpha = .1)

```
