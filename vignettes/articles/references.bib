  abstract = {Metabolomics research often requires the use of multiple analytical platforms, batches of samples, and laboratories, any of which can introduce a component of unwanted variation. In addition, every experiment is subject to within-platform and other experimental variation, which often includes unwanted biological variation. Such variation must be removed in order to focus on the biological information of interest. We present a broadly applicable method for the removal of unwanted variation arising from various sources for the identification of differentially abundant metabolites and, hence, for the systematic integration of data on the same quantities from different sources. We illustrate the versatility and the performance of the approach in four applications, and we show that it has several advantages over the existing normalization methods.},

  abstract = {Metabolomics experiments are inevitably subject to a component of unwanted variation, due to factors such as batch effects, long runs of samples, and confounding biological variation. Although the removal of this unwanted variation is a vital step in the analysis of metabolomics data, it is considered a gray area in which there is a recognized need to develop a better understanding of the procedures and statistical methods required to achieve statistically relevant optimal biological outcomes. In this paper, we discuss the causes of unwanted variation in metabolomics experiments, review commonly used metabolomics approaches for handling this unwanted variation, and present a statistical approach for the removal of unwanted variation to obtain normalized metabolomics data. The advantages and performance of the approach relative to several widely used metabolomics normalization approaches are illustrated through two metabolomics studies, and recommendations are provided for choosing and assessing the most suitable normalization method for a given metabolomics experiment. Software for the approach is made freely available.},

  abstract = {Objective: While the risk of acute coronary events has been associated with biological variability of circulating cholesterol, the association with variability of other atherogenic lipids remains less understood. We evaluated the longitudinal variability of 284 lipids and investigated their association with asymptomatic coronary atherosclerosis. Approach and Results: Circulating lipids were extracted from fasting blood samples of 83 community-sampled symptom-free participants (age 41--75 years), collected longitudinally over 6 months. Three types of coronary plaque volume (calcified, lipid-rich, and fibrotic) were quantified using computed tomography coronary angiogram. We first deconvoluted between-subject (CVg) and within-subject (CVw) lipid variabilities. We then tested whether the mean lipid abundance was different across groups categorized by Framingham risk score and plaques phenotypes (lipid-rich, fibrotic, and calcified). Finally, we investigated whether visit-to-visit variability of each lipid was associated with plaque burden. Most lipids (72.5\%) exhibited higher CVg than CVw. Among the lipids (n=145) with 1.2-fold higher CVg than CVw, 26 species including glycerides and ceramides were significantly associated with Framingham risk score and the 3 plaque phenotypes (false discovery rate {$<$}0.05). In an exploratory analysis of person-specific visit-to-visit variability without multiple testing correction, high variability of 3 lysophospholipids (lysophosphatidylethanolamines 16:0, 18:0, and lysophosphatidylcholine O-18:1) was associated with lipid-rich and fibrotic (noncalcified) plaque volume while high variability of diacylglycerol 18:1\_20:0, triacylglycerols 52:2, 52:3, and 52:4, ceramide d18:0/20:0, dihexosylceramide d18:1/16:0, and sphingomyelin 36:3 was associated with calcified plaque volume. Conclusions: High person-specific longitudinal variation of specific nonsterol lipids is associated with the burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. Larger studies are needed to confirm these exploratory findings.},

  abstract = {MRMkit is an open-source software package designed for automated data processing of large-scale targeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data. With increasing automation of sample preparation for LC-MS analysis, a challenging next step is to fully automate the workflow to process raw data and assure the quality of measurements in large-scale analysis settings. MRMkit capitalizes on the richness of large-sample data in capturing peak shapes and interference patterns of individual transitions across many samples and deliver fully automated, reproducible peak integration results in a scalable and time-efficient manner. In addition to fast and accurate peak integration, the tool also provides reliable data normalization functions and quality metrics along with visualizations for fast data quality evaluation. MRMkit learns the retention time offset patterns by user specified compound class and makes recommendations for peak picking in multi-modal ion chromatograms. In summary, MRMkit offers highly consistent and scalable data processing capacity to targeted metabolomics, substantially curtailing the time required to produce the final quantification results after the actual LC-MS analysis.},
